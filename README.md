## 📚 Project Overview

This project is a modern e-commerce platform focused on selling shoes. It features a responsive user interface, dynamic product listing, and basic cart functionality. Built using a modular and scalable architecture, it leverages several powerful tools and frameworks for seamless development and future extensibility.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

* **React.js**: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces using a component-based approach.
* **Redux Toolkit**: State management for React apps, simplifies the process of managing global app state.
* **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
* **JSON Server**: Used as a fake REST API to simulate a backend during development.
* **Material UI (MUI)**: UI component library for implementing consistent and visually appealing design.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used alongside MUI for additional customization and responsiveness.
* **Vercel**: Deployment platform for hosting the live application.
